# Creator Growth Navigator
Predict and optimize Instagram follower growth with actionable data science.

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

The Creator Growth Navigator is a data-driven ecosystem designed for creators and growth strategists to model, predict, and optimize Instagram follower growth. Powered by interpretable linear regression and advanced feature engineering, it blends scenario planning, diagnostics, and decision-support into a robust Streamlit application.

Whether you're an individual creator, agency, or data scientist, this tool equips you to answer:
How does my posting cadence, content mix, and engagement strategy drive follower growth—and what changes will yield best ROI?

-------------

## Key Features
- Single-Lever Regression: Models weekly follower growth using posting frequency as the main lever.

- Advanced Feature Engineering: Contextual enrichment via content mix, engagement weighting, posting timing, and consistency metrics.

- Time-Aware Validation: Cross-validation that respects temporal structure and provides predictive confidence intervals.

- Counterfactual Decision-Support: Interactive “what-if” analysis and ROI calculator for scenario planning.

- Robust Diagnostics: Saturation warnings, drift detection, outlier identification, and detailed residual analysis.

- Professional Streamlit UI: Modular dashboards for prediction, health monitoring, growth history, and strategic insights.

- Synthetic Data Pipeline: Realistic, configurable creator datasets spanning 2+ years; compatible with raw and benchmark data.

- Cloud-Ready Deployment: Containerized with Docker for seamless production launches.

## Workflow
Generate Synthetic or Import Real Data:
Use datagen/data_generator.py or ingest actual metrics into /data/raw/.

Explore and Validate Data:
Use notebooks in /notebooks/exploration/ for data profiling, EDA, and temporal analysis.

Engineer Features:
Prototype features (posting frequency, mix, engagement, timing) in /notebooks/feature_engineering/, output to /data/interim/ and /data/processed/.

Develop & Validate Model:
Build, fit, and diagnose regression models in /notebooks/modeling/, saving results for production use.

Run Streamlit Application:
Launch with:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app/Home.py
```
- Explore scenario planning, counterfactuals, and model health in interactive dashboards.

Deploy to Production:
Use Docker for reproducible, cloud-ready deployment:

```bash
docker build -t creator-growth-navigator .
docker run -p 8501:8501 creator-growth-navigator
```
