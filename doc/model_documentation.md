# Creator Growth Navigator - Model Documentation

## Model Overview

### Problem Statement
Predict Instagram follower growth based on posting frequency while maintaining model interpretability and actionability for content creators.

### Solution Approach
Simple linear regression with weekly posting frequency as the primary predictor, enriched with contextual features for content strategy insights.

## Model Architecture

### Core Model: Linear Regression
Weekly Follower Growth = β₀ + β₁(Weekly Posts) + β₂(Content Mix) + β₃(Timing) + β₄(Consistency) + ε

text

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Linear relationship**: Assumes proportional relationship between posting frequency and growth
- **Weekly aggregation**: Focuses on sustainable posting patterns rather than daily volatility
- **Single primary lever**: Weekly posting frequency as main predictor for simplicity
- **Contextual enrichment**: Additional features provide strategy insights without complexity

### Feature Engineering Pipeline

#### Primary Feature
- **Weekly Posting Frequency**: `(posts + reels + stories) / 7 days`
  - **Rationale**: Core lever creators can control
  - **Aggregation**: 7-day rolling window for consistency
  - **Range**: Typically 0-20 posts per week for most creators

#### Contextual Features
1. **Content Mix Ratio**
   - `share_posts = posts / total_content`
   - `share_reels = reels / total_content`  
   - `share_stories = stories / total_content`
   - **Purpose**: Understand optimal content distribution

2. **Timing Features**
   - `posted_in_optimal_window`: Binary (08:00, 18:30, 21:00)
   - `avg_posting_time`: Time of day analysis
   - **Purpose**: Capture audience engagement patterns

3. **Consistency Metrics**
   - `post_consistency_variance_7d`: Variance in daily posting
   - **Purpose**: Measure posting regularity impact

4. **Engagement Features**
   - `engagement_rate`: Interactions / reach
   - `avg_hashtag_count`: Hashtags per post
   - **Purpose**: Content quality proxies

5. **ROI Features**
   - `roi_follows_per_hour`: New follows / content creation time
   - `minutes_spent`: Total content creation time
   - **Purpose**: Efficiency and sustainability insights

## Model Training

### Data Preparation
Weekly aggregation from daily metrics
weekly_data = daily_data.groupby(pd.Grouper(freq='W')).agg({
'posts': 'sum',
'reels': 'sum',
'stories': 'sum',
'followers': 'last',
'engagement_rate': 'mean'
})

Calculate weekly growth
weekly_data['weekly_growth'] = weekly_data['followers'].diff()

Create posting frequency feature
weekly_data['weekly_posting_freq'] = (
weekly_data['posts'] +
weekly_data['reels'] +
weekly_data['stories']
)

### Training Process
1. **Time Series Split**: Respect temporal order (80% train, 20% test)
2. **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler for consistent coefficient interpretation
3. **Model Fitting**: Ordinary Least Squares estimation
4. **Validation**: Time-aware cross-validation with expanding window

### Hyperparameters
- **No regularization**: Maintains interpretability
- **Feature selection**: Manual selection based on domain knowledge
- **Outlier handling**: 3-sigma threshold for extreme values

## Model Performance

### Evaluation Metrics

#### Statistical Metrics
- **R² (Coefficient of Determination)**: Variance explained by model
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Average prediction error magnitude
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average absolute prediction error
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: Relative error percentage

#### Business Metrics
- **Directional Accuracy**: Correct prediction of growth direction
- **ROI Prediction Accuracy**: Efficiency metric validation
- **Confidence Interval Coverage**: Uncertainty quantification quality

### Expected Performance (Synthetic Data)
- **R²**: 0.65-0.75 (65-75% variance explained)
- **RMSE**: 150-250 followers per week
- **MAE**: 100-180 followers per week
- **Directional Accuracy**: 75-85%

### Performance Interpretation
- **R² > 0.7**: Strong relationship between posting and growth
- **RMSE < 200**: Predictions accurate within ±200 followers
- **Directional Accuracy > 80%**: Reliable growth direction prediction

## Model Assumptions

### Statistical Assumptions
1. **Linearity**: Relationship between posting frequency and growth is linear
2. **Independence**: Weekly observations are independent
3. **Homoscedasticity**: Constant variance in residuals
4. **Normality**: Residuals are normally distributed

### Business Assumptions
1. **Posting frequency is primary driver**: Other factors are secondary
2. **Linear growth**: No saturation effects in typical posting ranges
3. **Consistent audience**: Follower behavior remains stable
4. **Platform stability**: Instagram algorithm doesn't change dramatically

### Assumption Validation
Linearity check
plt.scatter(X['weekly_posting_freq'], y)

Homoscedasticity check
plt.scatter(y_pred, residuals)

Normality check

Independence check (Durbin-Watson test)

## Model Limitations

### Scope Limitations
- **Single platform**: Instagram-specific patterns
- **Linear assumption**: May not capture saturation effects
- **Historical bias**: Based on past patterns only
- **Feature limitations**: Missing external factors (viral content, algorithm changes)

### Data Limitations
- **Synthetic training data**: Requires real data validation
- **Sample size**: Performance depends on historical data length
- **Quality dependency**: Predictions only as good as input data

### Practical Limitations
- **External factors**: Cannot predict viral events or algorithm changes
- **Competitor effects**: Doesn't account for competitive landscape
- **Seasonal variations**: Limited seasonal pattern recognition
- **Content quality**: Posting frequency vs. content quality trade-offs
