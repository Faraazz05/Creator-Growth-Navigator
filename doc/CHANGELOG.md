All notable changes to Creator Growth Navigator will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial project setup and architecture
- Comprehensive documentation suite
- Docker containerization support

## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-19

### Added
- **Core Features**
  - Simple linear regression model for follower growth prediction
  - Weekly posting frequency as primary predictor variable
  - Synthetic data generation for 730 days of creator metrics
  - Streamlit interface with 5 main modules (Home, Predictor, Growth History, Decision Support, Model Health)

- **Data Pipeline**
  - Raw data ingestion and validation
  - Feature engineering for content mix, timing, and consistency
  - Automated weekly aggregation from daily metrics
  - ROI calculations (follows per hour of content creation)

- **Model Features**
  - Time-aware cross-validation for temporal data
  - Confidence interval estimation for predictions
  - Residual analysis and diagnostic checks
  - Drift detection and model health monitoring

- **User Interface**
  - Interactive prediction controls with real-time updates
  - Scenario planning and counterfactual analysis
  - Historical growth visualization with trend analysis
  - Performance dashboard with KPI tracking

- **Technical Infrastructure**
  - Modular codebase with clear separation of concerns
  - Comprehensive test suite covering all major components
  - Docker support for containerized deployment
  - Professional documentation (API, user guide, model docs)

### Technical Specifications
- **Model Type**: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Linear Regression
- **Primary Feature**: Weekly posting frequency (posts + reels + stories / 7 days)
- **Target Variable**: Weekly follower growth
- **Validation**: Time series cross-validation with 80/20 splits
- **Performance Metrics**: RÂ², RMSE, MAE, MAPE, directional accuracy

### Dependencies
- **Core**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels
- **Visualization**: plotly, seaborn, matplotlib, streamlit
- **Testing**: pytest, pytest-cov
- **Development**: black, flake8, mypy

### Known Limitations
- Model trained on synthetic data (requires real data for production use)
- Single-platform focus (Instagram only)
- Linear relationship assumption between posting frequency and growth
- Does not account for external factors (algorithm changes, viral content)

### Security
- No sensitive data handling in initial release
- Local deployment recommended for proprietary creator data
- Docker image security hardening implemented

## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-15

### Added
- Initial project conception and planning
- Basic data generation script for creator metrics
- Preliminary folder structure and requirements

### Development Notes
- Project rebuilt from scratch to address technical debt
- Focus on modularity and maintainability
- Emphasis on interpretable machine learning

## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0 Highlights

This initial release establishes Creator Growth Navigator as a focused, interpretable tool for modeling Instagram follower growth. The emphasis on simplicity (linear regression) combined with rich feature engineering creates a tool that's both actionable and trustworthy for creators.

**Key Strengths:**
- **Interpretability**: Clear relationship between posting frequency and growth
- **Actionability**: Specific recommendations for posting strategies
- **Robustness**: Comprehensive model diagnostics and validation
- **User Experience**: Professional Streamlit interface with intuitive navigation

**Roadmap for Future Releases:**
- Integration with real Instagram API data
- Multi-platform support (TikTok, YouTube, Twitter)
- Advanced modeling techniques (regularization, ensemble methods)
- Automated reporting and alerts
- Team collaboration features
